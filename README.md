# Vim 101

Companion repository for a presentation that I gave in November 2021.

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tr5Qtq6F_W4MUnoKHumL5DgDiqWBrraPxBI4Mw4rIJw/edit?usp=sharing).

The included `vimrc` extends
[vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible), and is intended to be
used as a guideline to create your own:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/tpope/start
cp vimrc ~/.vim/vimrc
cd ~/.vim/pack/tpope/start
git clone https://tpope.io/vim/sensible.git
```
